It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which allow you to easily handle structured data, perform operations like filtering, grouping, and joining, and read/write data from/to various file formats such as CSV, Excel, and SQL databases.\n","\n","`numpy`: Stands for Numerical Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. Numpy is widely used for numerical computations in fields like machine learning, scientific computing, and data analysis.\n","\n","`matplotlib.pyplot`: A plotting library that provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It allows you to create various types of plots such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, etc., to visualize data and explore relationships between variables.\n","\n","`seaborn`: Built on top of matplotlib, seaborn provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations like categorical plots, distribution plots, regression plots, and heatmaps. Seaborn also integrates well with pandas DataFrame objects.\n","\n","`warnings`: Python's built-in module for issuing warnings to alert users about potential issues or deprecated features in their code. In the given context, warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\") suppresses the display of warning messages, which can be helpful when you want to avoid cluttering your output with non-critical warnings.\n","\n","`wordcloud`: A library for creating word clouds from text data. Word clouds visually represent the frequency of words in a text corpus, where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency. It's often used in text analysis and visualization to identify prominent words or topics within a body of text.\n","\n","`sklearn.preprocessing`: Part of scikit-learn (sklearn), this submodule provides various functions for preprocessing data before feeding it into machine learning models. This includes scaling features, encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and more.\n","\n","`sklearn.cluster`: Another submodule of scikit-learn, it provides implementations of various clustering algorithms for unsupervised learning tasks. The KMeans class imported from this submodule is used to perform K-means clustering, a popular method for partitioning data into clusters based on similarity.\n","\n","Each of these libraries serves a specific purpose in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning workflows, and they are often used together to perform end-to-end data analysis tasks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"85ccc716","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002996,"end_time":"2024-03-03T11:07:53.579662","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-03T11:07:53.576666","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/TNKDH3dV1GAMVP6aMeWC7HFjhAYdkiFCEafVtn2qcE2RSpMd7vO3eY75rPDgWGSQ4bRfNKAQL-H9Y7H85aptikS4uQIPLBqZQBWL-pyGeUwvsJDXZpPaxP68WazXFs97iU9t8m2Ib6xXDnsa20D8sXwWlj0\" width=\"100%\" heigh=\"100%\" alt=\"Retrieve&Re-Rank pipeline\"></div>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"83cd0c19","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-03T11:07:53.58948Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-03T11:07:53.588241Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-03T11:07:57.419852Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-03T11:07:57.418173Z"},"papermill":{"duration":3.840019,"end_time":"2024-03-03T11:07:57.423235","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-03T11:07:53.583216","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n","from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"47b90484","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-03T11:07:57.432376Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-03T11:07:57.431668Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-03T11:07:57.601534Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-03T11:07:57.600411Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.177403,"end_time":"2024-03-03T11:07:57.604114","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-03-03T11:07:57.426711","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>\n","      <th>Title</th>\n","      <th>Author</th>\n","      <th>Main Genre</th>\n","      <th>Sub Genre</th>\n","      <th>Type</th>\n","      <th>Price</th>\n","      <th>Rating</th>\n","      <th>No. of People rated</th>\n","      <th>URLs</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>The Complete Novel of Sherlock Holmes</td>\n","      <td>Arthur Conan Doyle</td>\n","      <td>Arts, Film &amp;
