    "Analyzing `recursive algorithms` can be a bit more involved than analyzing `iterative algorithms`. Here's a breakdown of the key steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Identifying Base Case and Recursive Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to understand how the recursion works. A recursive function breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems of the same type and then solves those subproblems. There are two crucial parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Case: This is the simplest case where the problem can be solved directly without any further recursion. It's the stopping condition for the recursion.\n",
    "Recursive Case: This case defines how the larger problem is broken down into smaller subproblems. The function calls itself with these smaller subproblems as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Writing the Recurrence Relation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a recursive function, the time or space complexity can often be expressed as a recurrence relation. This is an equation that relates the complexity of the function for a given input size to the complexity of the function for smaller input sizes. The recurrence relation captures the cost of a single function call (including overhead) and how it relates to the cost of solving the subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Solving the Recurrence Relation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various techniques for solving recurrence relations, depending on the nature of the relation. Some common methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitution: This involves repeatedly substituting the recursive formula for itself until a base case is reached, allowing us to express the complexity in terms of simpler terms.\n",
    "Master Theorem: This is a general theorem for analyzing divide-and-conquer recurrences with specific properties. It provides a way to classify the recurrence and estimate its complexity based on factors like the work done per level and the problem size reduction factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Considering Efficiency Factors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the recurrence relation gives us a general understanding of the complexity, it's important to consider **additional factors** that might ***affect the overall efficiency***:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Number and Size of Subproblems`: How many subproblems are created at each level of recursion, and how much smaller are they compared to the original problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Work Done at Each Level`: How much work is done at each level of recursion besides the function calls themselves (e.g., calculations, comparisons)?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Depth of the Recursion Tree`: How many levels of recursion are there before reaching the base case?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Space Complexity`: Recursive functions use additional space on the call stack for each recursive call. Analyzing the space complexity involves understanding how much space is used at each level of recursion."
