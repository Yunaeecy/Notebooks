    "# Merge Sort and Quick Sort: A Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Merge Sort and Quick Sort are efficient sorting algorithms commonly used to organize data. While they share the goal of sorting elements, their approaches differ significantly, leading to distinct advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Merge Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Divide and Conquer`: Merge Sort follows a **divide-and-conquer strategy**. It recursively splits the input list into smaller sub-lists until each sub-list contains only one element (which is inherently sorted). Then, it repeatedly merges the sorted sub-lists back together to produce a new sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Stable Sort`: Merge Sort maintains the relative order of equal elements, making it a stable sorting algorithm. This is crucial when sorting data where element order matters beyond their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Time Complexity`: Merge Sort has a consistent time complexity of **O(n log n)** for all cases (best, average, and worst). This predictable performance makes it reliable for tasks where consistent sorting speed is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Space Complexity`: The main drawback of Merge Sort is its O(n) space complexity. Due to the need for temporary sub-lists during the merging process, it requires additional memory proportional to the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quick Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Partitioning`: Quick Sort works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two sub-lists, one containing elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater than the pivot. This process is recursively applied to the sub-lists until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Unstable Sort`: Unlike Merge Sort, Quick Sort is an unstable sorting algorithm. It does not guarantee the preservation of the relative order of equal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Time Complexity`: \n",
    "Best Case: **O(n log n)** - This occurs when the pivot consistently divides the list into two nearly equal halves. In this scenario, the partitioning process is highly efficient, leading to a logarithmic number of recursion levels and linear time for partitioning at each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Case: **O(n log n)** - On average, even with random pivot selection, Quick Sort performs well and achieves the same time complexity as the best case. The partitioning may not always be perfectly balanced, but it tends to be close enough to maintain efficient sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst Case: **O(n^2)** - The worst-case scenario happens when the pivot selection consistently chooses the smallest or largest element in the list. This leads to highly unbalanced partitions, with one sub-list containing only one element and the other containing the rest. As a result, the recursion depth becomes linear (n levels), and at each level, we still need to iterate through a nearly full list, leading to the quadratic time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Space Complexity`: Quick Sort typically requires only O(log n) additional space for the recursive call stack, making it more memory-efficient than Merge Sort. However, in the worst case, it may require O(n) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Right Algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between Merge Sort and Quick Sort depends on the specific requirements of your application:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Predictable Performance`: If consistent time complexity is critical, regardless of the input data, Merge Sort is the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Memory Usage`: If memory usage is a major concern, Quick Sort is generally more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Stability`: When maintaining the relative order of equal elements is crucial, Merge Sort is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Average-Case Performance`: If optimizing for the average case and accepting the possibility of worst-case scenarios, Quick Sort might be preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Conclusion:\n",
    "Both Merge Sort and Quick Sort offer efficient ways to sort data, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Understanding their differences allows you to choose the most suitable algorithm for your specific needs."

    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Base Case: If the list has one or zero elements, it's already sorted, so it is returned as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Divide: The list is divided into two halves, left_half and right_half.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Conquer: merge_sort is called recursively on each half, sorting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Merge: The `merge` step is where the actual sorting happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two pointers (`i` and `j`) are used to track the current elements in the     `left_half` and `right_half`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements are compared and added to the `sorted_arr` in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any remaining elements in either half are added to the end of `sorted_arr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Return: The sorted_arr is returned, completing the sorting process."
