    "# AVL Trees: A Deep Dive into Balanced Binary Search Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "AVL trees, named after their inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis, are a specific type of `self-balancing binary search tree`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means they maintain the efficient search property of BSTs while ensuring the tree remains balanced to avoid **worst-case scenarios** that could lead to O(n) search times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of their `key features`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balancing Act**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Balance Factor: Each node in an AVL tree has a balance factor, calculated as the height difference between its left and right subtrees. This factor can be `-1, 0, or 1` in a balanced state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rotations: If a node's balance factor becomes -2 or 2 due to insertions or deletions, the tree performs rotations to restore balance. These rotations can be **single or double and involve rearranging nodes** to maintain the BST property while achieving a balanced structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of AVL Trees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Guaranteed Search Efficiency: The balanced nature ensures search, insertion, and deletion operations have an average and worst-case time complexity of O(log n), making them efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Adaptability: AVL trees automatically adjust their structure during insertions and deletions, maintaining balance without user intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of AVL Trees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Overhead of Rotations`: Maintaining balance through rotations adds some computational overhead compared to basic BSTs, especially during insertions and deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Implementation Complexity`: Implementing rotations and balance factor calculations can be more complex than basic BST operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use AVL Trees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Frequent Searches, Insertions, and Deletions`: If your application requires frequent updates and retrievals from the data structure, AVL trees provide a good balance between efficiency and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Predictable Performance`: If you need guaranteed performance and cannot afford worst-case scenarios of O(n) search times, AVL trees offer reliable logarithmic time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternatives to AVL Trees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Red-Black Trees`: Another self-balancing BST structure with less strict balancing rules than AVL trees. \n",
    "They may perform slightly **worse** in some search scenarios but require fewer rotations, potentially leading to better performance in update-heavy use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "`B-Trees`: Suitable for scenarios involving large datasets stored on secondary storage (like disks) due to their optimized data block access patterns."

    "# Implementing AVL Trees with Python Lists: A Conceptual Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "While using Python lists directly to represent an AVL tree is possible, it's not the most efficient or common approach. \n",
    "Typically, nodes are represented as custom objects with left and right child references. \n",
    "However, for learning purposes, let's explore a conceptual implementation using lists to understand the core principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions and Simplifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a list to represent a single node, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "index 0: Stores the node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "index 1: Stores the balance factor (-1, 0, or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "index 2: Stores the left child node (represented as another list).\n",
    "\n",
    "index 3: Stores the right child node (represented as another list).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on the core operations of insertion and rotations to illustrate the balancing mechanism. Deletion and other operations would follow similar principles."

    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node in the AVL tree is represented as a list with four elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* value: The actual data value stored in the node.\n",
    "* balance_factor: An integer (-1, 0, or 1) representing the height difference between the left and right subtrees.\n",
    "* left_child: A reference (another list) to the left child node.\n",
    "* right_child: A reference (another list) to the right child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `insert` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "This function recursively inserts a new value into the AVL tree while maintaining the balance property.\n",
    "\n",
    "`BST Insertion`: The first part of the function follows standard BST insertion logic:\n",
    "* If the tree is empty (root is None), create a new node.\n",
    "* If the value is less than the current node's value, recursively insert it into the left subtree.\n",
    "* Otherwise, recursively insert it into the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Balance Factor Update`: After insertion, the `balance_factor` of the current node and potentially its ancestors need to be updated. This is done by calculating the height difference between the left and right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Rotations`: If the `balance_factor` of a node becomes -2 or 2 (indicating imbalance), rotations are performed to restore balance. The code handles four different rotation cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Left Left Case: A right rotation is performed.\n",
    "* Right Right Case: A left rotation is performed.\n",
    "* Left Right Case: A right rotation followed by a left rotation is performed.\n",
    "* Right Left Case: A left rotation followed by a right rotation is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotations (left_rotate and right_rotate Functions):\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions perform the actual rotations by rearranging the nodes to achieve a balanced state while maintaining the **BST property**. They involve updating child and parent pointers to achieve the desired structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Correction`: The `right_rotate` function now includes a check to ensure that y (the left child) exists before accessing its children to avoid the `TypeError` we encountered previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Height Calculation (get_height Function):\n",
    "\n",
    "This function recursively calculates the height of a subtree rooted at a given node. It's used to determine the `balance_factor` and make decisions about rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code focuses on the core operations of insertion and rotations to illustrate the AVL tree's self-balancing mechanism.\n",
    "* This implementation uses lists to represent nodes for simplicity and understanding. For practical applications, using node objects with references is more efficient and manageable.\n",
    "* The code assumes that the input values are unique. Handling duplicate values would require additional logic.\n",

    "# AVL Trees: Best, Worst, and Average Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the time complexity for the three main operations in AVL trees, covering the best, worst, and average cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation\tBest Case\tWorst Case\tAverage Case\n",
    "Search  \tO(1)    \tO(log n)\tO(log n)\n",
    "Insertion\tO(log n)\tO(log n)\tO(log n)\n",
    "Deletion\tO(log n)\tO(log n)\tO(log n)\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search**:\n",
    "Best Case (O(1)): The element being searched for is the root of the tree, requiring only one comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst and Average Case (O(log n)): The balanced nature of AVL trees ensures that search operations take logarithmic time, even in the worst-case scenario, due to the tree's height being logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insertion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Case (O(log n)): The new node is inserted at or near the bottom of the tree, requiring minimal updates to balance factors and no rotations. The time complexity remains logarithmic due to traversing the tree to find the insertion point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst and Average Case (O(log n)): Insertion may cause imbalances, but the AVL tree's self-balancing mechanism through rotations ensures that restoring balance also takes logarithmic time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deletion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Case (O(log n)): The node to be deleted is a leaf node or has only one child, minimizing the need for rebalancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst and Average Case (O(log n)): Deletion might require finding a successor or predecessor and rebalancing the tree through rotations, but the time complexity remains logarithmic due to the tree's balanced nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Efficiency`: AVL trees provide efficient performance across all three operations, with logarithmic time complexity dominating in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Predictability`: The guaranteed worst-case logarithmic time complexity makes AVL trees reliable and suitable for applications where consistent performance is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Versatility`: The combination of efficient best, average, and worst-case behavior makes AVL trees a versatile choice for various data storage and retrieval needs."
