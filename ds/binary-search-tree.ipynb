    "# Binary Search Tree Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary search tree is a node-based data structure that follows specific rules to maintain order and enable efficient search operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each node in the tree holds a key (and optionally, an associated value).\n",
    "* The left subtree of a node contains only keys less than the node's key.\n",
    "* The right subtree of a node contains only keys greater than the node's key.\n",
    "* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties ensure that the tree remains ordered, allowing us to use the efficient binary search algorithm to locate specific keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Operations on BSTs\n",
    "\n",
    "`Search`: To find a specific key, we start at the root and compare the key with the current node's key. If the  key is smaller, we move to the left subtree; otherwise, we move to the right subtree. This process continues until we find the key or reach a null node (indicating the key is not present).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Insertion`: To insert a new key, we use the same approach as searching to find the appropriate position in the tree. Once we reach a null node, we insert the new node there.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Deletion`: Deleting a node is a bit more complex and involves different cases depending on the node's structure (e.g., leaf node, node with one child, node with two children). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of BSTs**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Efficient Searching`: BSTs enable efficient searching with an average time complexity of O(log n), making them suitable for scenarios where search operations are frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Dynamic`: BSTs can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are inserted or deleted, making them flexible for handling changing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ordered Data`: BSTs maintain data in a sorted order, which can be useful for operations like finding the minimum or maximum value, range queries, and in-order traversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of BSTs**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Worst-Case Scenario`: In the worst-case scenario, where the tree becomes unbalanced (e.g., all nodes have only left or right children), the search time can degrade to O(n), similar to a linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Balancing Required`: To ensure optimal performance, BSTs often require balancing techniques (e.g., AVL trees, red-black trees) to prevent unbalanced trees and maintain efficient search times.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time complexities of BSTs\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to insertion sort, binary search trees have three main time complexities depending on the structure of the tree and the operation being performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Best Case`: When the binary search tree is balanced, meaning the left and right subtrees of each node have roughly the same number of elements, search, insertion, and deletion operations exhibit a time complexity of `O(log n)`. This is because, with each comparison, we effectively halve the search space, leading to a logarithmic number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Average Case`: In the average case, assuming random insertions and a reasonably balanced tree, the time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion also remains `O(log n)`. This makes BSTs efficient for most general-purpose use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Worst Case`: The worst-case scenario occurs when the binary search tree is completely unbalanced, resembling a linked list (all nodes have only left or right children). In this case, searching for an element would require traversing all nodes, leading to a time complexity of `O(n)`.\n",

    "1.`Node Class`:\n",
    "* The Node class represents a single node in the tree.\n",

    "* The BinarySearchTree class represents the overall tree structure.\n",
    "* __init__: Initializes the BST with an empty root node.\n",
    "* insert(data): Inserts data into the BST. It handles the case of an empty tree and then calls the _insert helper function.\n",
