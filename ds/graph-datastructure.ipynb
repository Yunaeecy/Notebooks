    "# Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are widely used to model relationships between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs have several `characteristics` that define their structure and properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Vertices (Nodes)`: Graphs consist of a set of vertices, which are the entities or objects in the graph. Vertices are often represented as points or circles in visual representations of graphs.\n",
    "Edges: Edges are the connections between vertices in a graph. They represent relationships or connections between the entities represented by the vertices. Edges can be directed or undirected, and they can have weights assigned to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Adjacency`: Two vertices are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them. In directed graphs, adjacency can be asymmetric, meaning one vertex is adjacent to another but not necessarily vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Degree`: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. In directed graphs, there are two types of degree: in-degree (number of incoming edges) and out-degree (number of outgoing edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Path`: A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. Paths can be simple (no repeated vertices) or cyclic (ends at the same vertex).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cycle`: A cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, traversing a sequence of edges without repeating any vertex (except the starting and ending vertex).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Connectivity`: Graphs can be connected or disconnected. A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices. If not, it is disconnected.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Weight`: Some graphs have weights associated with their edges. These weights represent numerical values that could signify distances, costs, or any other relevant metric associated with traversing that edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Directed vs. Undirected`: Graphs can be directed, where edges have a specific direction, or undirected, where edges have no direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cyclic vs. Acyclic`: A graph containing cycles is cyclic, while a graph without cycles is acyclic.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Density`: The density of a graph refers to the ratio of the number of edges to the maximum possible number of edges in the graph. It characterizes how many connections exist among the vertices."
